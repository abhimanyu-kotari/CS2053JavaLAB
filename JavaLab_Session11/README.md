## 🎯 Problem Statement
Use lambda expressions to sort a list of `Product` objects based on price and name.

## 🌍 Real-World Scenario
Online shopping platforms use sorting and filtering logic to display products based on user preferences like **price** or **name**.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Lambda expressions  
- Functional interfaces  
- Comparator and Consumer interfaces  
- Sorting collections with custom logic  

## 📘 Description
This Java program demonstrates:
- Sorting `ArrayList<Product>` using lambda expressions  
- Using a custom functional interface (`Discount`) to apply discounts  
- Using built-in `Consumer` interface to print product details  

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Compile all `.java` files:
```bash
javac Product.java ProductSorter.java
