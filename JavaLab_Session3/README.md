## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced
- Inheritance (Multilevel)
- Method Overriding
- `super` Keyword
- Constructor Chaining

## ðŸ“˜ Program Description
This Java program demonstrates a class hierarchy `Vehicle â†’ Car â†’ ElectricCar` showing inheritance, method overriding, and the use of the `super` keyword for constructor chaining and accessing parent methods.

## ðŸ§© Code Flow
1. `Vehicle` is the base class.
2. `Car` extends `Vehicle` and overrides the `displayInfo()` method.
3. `ElectricCar` extends `Car` and adds battery capacity information.
4. `super` is used to invoke parent class constructors and methods.
